/**
 * @dev Pool contracts with the MinimalSwapInfo or TwoToken specialization settings should implement this interface.
 *
 * This is called by the Vault when a user calls `IVault.batchSwapGivenIn` or `IVault.batchSwapGivenOut` to swap with
 * this Pool. Returns the number of tokens the Pool will grant to the user (if GivenIn) or that the user will grant to
 * the pool (if GivenOut) as part of the swap.
 *
 * This can often be implemented by a `view` function, since many pricing algorithms don't need to track state
 * changes in swaps. However, contracts implementing this in non-view functions should check that the caller is
 * indeed the Vault.
